Elede Lab's legacy website

This is the now offline Elede Lab Website. I have mantained a running copy over here [Legacy Elede Lab](http://elede.milohaus.com)
in case you want to check it out. 

Also, while building the website, I developed a neat little toy that transforms Input text into an SVG Image and then uses
[Particle Slider](http://particleslider.com/) to transform it into reactive particles. That's also available here 
[Legacy Particles](http://elede.milohaus.com/ideas-valiosas) and you should check it out. 

Needless to say, there won't be any updates to this repo, but feel free to use anything you find useful. Particle Slider Code
is not included, since it's a paid license.
